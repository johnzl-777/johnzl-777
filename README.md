Greetings! I'm currently a Scientific Software Developer at [QuEra Computing Inc.](https://www.quera.com/) helping build a little bit of everything from compilers and SDKs to hardware telemetry and educational resources for neutral atom quantum computers.

Previously I worked at [If and Only If Technologies](https://iff.bio/) as a Quantum Software Engineer and helped develop workshops for students at [Quantum Computing at Davis](https://quist.ucdavis.edu/QCD) when I was obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at [UC Davis](https://ece.ucdavis.edu/). 

I've also interned at [Sandia National Labs](https://www.sandia.gov/), [General Dynamics Mission Systems](https://gdmissionsystems.com/), and [Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) (2x) as a Software Engineering Intern (: 

### üì¶ Current Contributions
